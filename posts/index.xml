Not sure yet. But it’s likely big.
 Friends and family for now. Invite only. Americans eat 849lb beef/second, per wolfram alpha. That a lot of consumers. Not sure how many people in the Kenmore / Redmond / Seattle area eat steak regularly. Need more research.  Provide Feedback</description>

 temperature: 32-39.2deg If the temperature is above this, the germs multiply. At temperatures below the freezing point, the enzymes can not work and the meat does not ripen. humidity: 80-85% It is possible to vary the humidity easily between 60-90%. This slightly changes the flavor, which makes the final product more individual. At higher values, however, the possibility of mold attack increases. At low levels, the outer crust dries deeper and deeper.</description>

Price.
 Choice quality is $3/lb more than the recent past. In September, Steak was 2x the price from prior years. Prime+ quality steaks are too expensive for most people, $30-50/lb Steak consumption doesn’t seem to be declining, even with the alternative impossible (not) meat trend. Maybe real steak consumption is increasing because of the fear of scarcity.  Provide Feedback</description>

Price. Most people choose choice quality steak, for affordability. $12/lb compared to the $16/lb for Prime. (Nov 6 2021). The prices are $3-4/lb higher than 3y average.
Aged steak is even more expensive Aged steaks make an average steak even better, but can sell for 3x the price per lb.

Aging steak makes something delicious even better.
Dry aging tenderizes and enhances the flavor through enzymatic and bacterial action, along with the oxidation of fat. Dry-aged meat will develop beefy, nutty, and almost cheese-like aromas.
